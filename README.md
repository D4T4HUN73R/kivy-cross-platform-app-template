# kivy-cross-platform-app-template
This template creates a simple mobile app with a single button that displays the text "Hello World". The MyApp class is a subclass of the App class from the kivy.app module, and the build() method returns a Button widget. The app is run by calling the run() method of the MyApp instance.
